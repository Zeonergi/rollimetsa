<blockquote>"I wonder how my cousins in Arroyo are doing? I hope they're flourishing."<br>
"Of course they are! Unless some rat-bastard slaughters them all."<br>
--Seymour and Typhon</blockquote>

It seems you're the only one around with a fashion sense, and now you have access to the Pipboy as well. First off go talk to the Elder to get your quests proper, Vic's Water Flask and some cash ($152 to be precise, but you don't get it if your Intelligence is below 4). Klamath will already be on the world map.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star2.gif" alt="a blue star" align="left">
As good an opportunity as any to practise being polite. Like I said in the introduction, I'm assuming you want to do as much as possible of what's available to you, and this means you really won't be able to role-play either an inherently noble character or a terminally sarcastic one. The former because there are several quests where you'll get your best result doing something "bad" to begin with, then following up with something good, as well as other borderline or outright evil quests which are simply too neat to pass up. The latter because it's a well-known fact that in computer RPGs which let you play an "evil" or grouchy character, you'll ultimately be punished for doing so because if you tell everyone you meet how ugly they are, they won't give you quests or bonuses. Such is life. You can always pretend you're role-playing a psychopath who acts nice outwardly because he knows it will suit his purposes, while all the time thinking of new ways to strangle people with their own intestines.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
If you attacked Klint or Cameron in the Temple of Trials section, everyone will be hostile when you arrive here. You can run to the exit of the village before they can kill you, but then the game will end. The game will also come to a stop if you manage to end combat (for instance by running to the hunting grounds) and rest until midnight. Same thing happens should you ever attack anyone in Arroyo (or even off them with Super Stimpaks), so don't.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
Using the Steal skill on any of the unarmed wandering villagers and passing a Steal check will lower your karma even if you don't take anything (they have nothing to take). This can mess up your dealings with Hakunin, so watch out.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
On special dates your Pipboy will say things like "Happy New Year!" and "Happy Valentine's Day!". Ain't that cute. It also has its own screen saver which shows falling bombs.</blockquote>

The nutty old shaman Hakunin will heal you to full HP and remove poison for free at any time, providing your karma is not negative. Talk to the not-so-bright Feargus by the well, then fix it (Repair) for 100 xp. This can be done no matter how low your Repair skill. Everyone else includes this in their walkthrough so I guess I should too: there's $100 in aunt Morlis' hut which you should go and grab even if you're not going to search all the containers around you... but you <i>are</i>, right?

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star.gif" alt="a red star" align="left">
Ever wondered why there is at least one Feargus or similarly named character in each of <i>Fallout 2</i>, <i>Baldur's Gate</i>, <i>Baldur's Gate II</i>, <i>Planescape: Torment</i> and <i>Icewind Dale</i>? It might have something to do with Black Isle director Feargus MacRae Urquhart; there are close to a dozen names in these games derived from his (including Cassidy's original name, which shows up if you sell him to Metzger). Names of other developers abound, but none of them sticks out as much. "Smitty" is another ubiquitous cognomen - there are four of those in the two <i>Fallout</i> games, and there might well have been a fifth...</blockquote>

If you have AG 6, talk to Lucas by the stone head and he'll train you to Unarmed 40% if your current skill level is lower than that, else to 55% if you aren't this good already (a good reason not to tag that skill). He has a bag of Healing Powder, so take it and leave him with a few useless Scorpion Tails instead, since you probably can't carry them all into the desert anyway. If you want to barter, do it before the training. Talk to Jordan in the tent northeast of there for +10% to your Melee Weapons if your currect skill level is 36% or higher (if you don't meet the requirement you can return later in the game and get the training). Cameron at the top of the map will give you +10% Unarmed and +10% Melee Weapons, but only if your AG is 6 or less and you tagged none of the six combat skills (if you're proficient with Big Guns he apparently thinks you're ready to face the horrors of the wasteland). Depending on your starting skill you might want to get Lucas' bonus first. In case you forgot your stuff in the temple, or you have a craving to bash some helpless left-over scorpions, you can re-enter the temple by taking the northern exit grid to the front entrance or by entering the cave beside Cameron.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star2.gif" alt="a blue star" align="left">
Skill rises received from training or other activities can be affected by whether or not you've tagged the skill in question and/or whether it's above 101%. Thus values given in the guide may not always exactly correspond to what you actually end up with.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
Because of a bug you need to get Cameron's training before talking to Hakunin at all.</blockquote>

During the game you'll see four Hakunin dream sequences, which will befall you on 23 Oct 2241, 21 Jan 2242, 21 Apr 2242 and 20 Jul 2242. When you leave Vault 13 after getting the xp for finding it (no matter if you got the G.E.C.K. or even talked to the deathclaws), or leave San Francisco after getting the tanker ready to go, you'll always jump ahead to the fourth sequence ("the village dies"). As time passes the garden and fields will go empty and people will become generally despairing. After 90 days, which corresponds to the first Hakunin dream sequence, you will be unable to get (or to finish, if you already got them) quests 1, 3 and 4, and Hakunin won't give you healing or make Healing Powder any more. After 91 days you'll be unable to get the Water Flask and cash from the Elder.<br><br>

If you return to Arroyo after seeing the fourth Hakunin dream sequence, the bridge will be destroyed and the village inaccessible. A dying Hakunin will greet you with a story of how the villagers were taken south in vertibirds, and Navarro appears on your world map. You don't have to return here and whether you do or not has basically no effect on the rest of the game.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
If you find Vault 13 but don't enter it, Arroyo won't change, but Hakunin's description and dialogue will! This should be a pretty rare occurrence, but it did happen to me once. Hakunin won't actually die after you talk to him, and it won't put Navarro on your world map. Another funny thing is that if you're in Arroyo when you get the fourth vision and talk to Nagor, he'll tell you that Morlis cooked Smoke... but if you didn't rescue Smoke already, you can go and do that (although as noted above you get no xp for it and Nagor's dialogue doesn't change).</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
The Arroyo bridge location will actually change to a whole new map, so if your car is parked there at the time it will be lost forever, along with any NPCs left on that map or any other Arroyo map.</blockquote>

<ol>
<b></b><li><b>Rescue Nagor's dog, Smoke, from the wilds.</b><br><br>

Nagor is to the east of Hakunin's garden, the dog is in the hunting grounds area to the west. Go there, kill any hostile geckos (or Sneak past them), grab all the Broc Flowers and Xander Roots you can get, and avoid stepping on the green slime. When you get to the dog at the top left it'll follow you back and even help you kill geckos on the way. The flowers and geckos reset every day if you leave the map and return. It may seem like an idea to stay here and level up from killing geckos, but actually it's much more work than it's worth, so only do that if you're close to levelling up already and can't wait (or see the note below). You get 100 xp for returning the dog alive. If you tell Nagor the dog died, he'll run off on his own to look for it unless you ask him not to, and he'll also take off if you turn down the quest. If you then follow him to the hunting grounds, he'll be lying dead next to a dead gecko, the dog will be gone, and you can't strike the quest off your quest list. But you can take a Spear from Nagor's cold body.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
Zuger's patented levelling technique: "The easiest way to get xp from stealing is from the drugged-up geckos in Arroyo. Just plant and steal Broc Flowers. Easiest way to level up early on in the game. Gets a bit tedious though. With a Steal of like 10% I managed to steal and plant Broc Flowers at least 5 times." Make sure there are no hostile geckos nearby if you do this, since the peaceful ones will turn hostile as well if you start a fight.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star2.gif" alt="a blue star" align="left">
In combat, all normal and golden geckos will run for and eat any Iguana-on-a-stick or Meat Jerky dropped on the ground, attacking if they have any AP left. They will also pick up punching weapons like Spiked Knuckles and Power Fists! And then use them against you!</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star2.gif" alt="a blue star" align="left">
This is only the first of many quests, dialogues and details which will be unavailable if your Intelligence is less than 4. I won't bother to tell you about that any more, but I will note where there are special benefits or odd happenings to be gained from being stupid.</blockquote>

<b></b></li><li><b>Find Vic the Trader.</b><br><br>

This won't happen for a little while yet. If you're curious, see the Den, quest 8.<br><br>

<b></b></li><li><b>Obtain flint to have Mynoc sharpen your spear.</b><br><br>

Talk to the guard by the bridge on the village perimeter. If you have at least PE 6 you can ask him about his spear, and he'll send you to your grumpy aunt to get some Flint. You can:<br><br>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Buy it from her in dialogue with 3 Healing Powder.
</li><li>Barter one Scorpion Tail for it.
</li><li>Ask nicely for it if you have at least Speech 51% and pass a skill check, 50 xp in this.
</li><li>Steal it.
</li><li>Get caught stealing twice and she'll give it to you.
</li></ul><br>

If you got it by bartering, stealing or getting caught stealing you can still get the xp for using Speech, or even another piece of Flint by trading Healing Powder, but there's no use for two. When you return to Mynoc he turns one of your Spears into a Sharpened Spear, which is good. Better yet, drop all your Spears beforehand and he'll give you a new one. Tribals are kinda stupid.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
After you've been to Klamath or the Den, Mynoc's dialogue changes so you can't get or finish the quest.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star2.gif" alt="a blue star" align="left">
Geoffrey Bateman reports a cheat with far-reaching applications: "When you talk to Aunt Morlis and try to get the Flint from her, get to the screen where you have the option of saying something like, 'Sure, I have 3 healing powders right here', then go to the barter screen, drop all your Healing Powders, go back to the talk screen, and select that dialogue option. You get the Flint without losing anything (the game only checks your inventory before displaying the dialogue option, not after you select it), then you just have to pick up your Powders. It also works with upgrading weapons. Just get to the screen where you choose the specific weapon to be upgraded, then switch to barter and drop the gun before selecting it to be upgraded; you'll get the upgraded weapon (full of ammo, of course) from the person, then you can pick up your non-upgraded gun. Unfortunately, this won't work with Algernon, who won't barter, so you have to pay for the upgrade to make this work. This trick might also be useful in situations where you pay someone through a dialogue choice, like paying Metzger for Vic: drop all your money, then 'pay' him, pick up your money..." You can get all four combat implants for free in Redding this way, for one thing, as long as you carry $30,000 and one suit of Combat Armor. Sebastian Cassten who also told me about the trick notes that you can use it to keep quest items (such as the above-mentioned Flint), although this will appeal exclusively to item hoarders.</blockquote>

<b></b></li><li><b>Kill the evil plants that infest Hakunin's garden.</b><br><br>

Talk to Hakunin and agree to kill the plants, or just go and kill them. They shouldn't be too much of a problem. You gain 100 xp. Report back to Hakunin for 2 Healing Powders, and he will now be able to concoct Healing Powder if you give him a Broc Flower and a Xander Root. Since it's possible you won't return here, scout the hunting grounds until you have an equal number of roots and flowers, then turn them all into powder. Do keep any roots and flowers you find in the future, though, since you'll get another chance to make use of them (and until you get the first dream sequence you can always return and enlist Hakunin's skills again).

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
The ranged attack of the plants is considerably less dangerous than their bite (plus they run out of spikes pretty quickly), so a good gardening technique is to hit them once, run away two hexes and end turn, then move in and repeat.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
If you have negative karma or if you've offended Hakunin, he'll offer this quest as a way of making amends. In the former case you still have to get your karma to 0 or better before he will give you the reward. In the latter case, keep insulting him until his reaction level drops so low that he forgets he's mad at you (bug). After that he'll offer normal dialogue, although the talking head looks none too happy.</blockquote>

<b></b></li><li><b>Retrieve the GECK for Arroyo.</b><br><br>

This won't happen for a <i>long</i> while yet (unless you're using stupid short cut techniques). You gain 4000 xp when you first lay hands on a G.E.C.K.

<a name="bh"></a><h3>Broken Hills</h3>

<blockquote>"Sometimes I feel like a magic 8-ball. I just spout random sayings and walk away."<br>
--Broken Hills resident</blockquote>

Broken Hills is one of the two mining towns in this game, unique when it comes to the way that humans, ghouls and mutants live together. If you put away your weapons, you can talk to Steve the town greeter and learn a few things. The first time you arrive here in the car, you'll hit poor Lumpy who gives you a reference to a special encounter in <i>Fallout</i>.<br><br>

Liz runs the general store. If you have negative karma you can ask her what there is around to kill; if you get a bad reaction and annoy her she won't talk to you at all. Characters with high Steal can attempt to simply pick her table clean. She has some minor stuff in her basement (four containers with weapons, including a Combat Shotgun), but she won't let you go down there to begin with. With a good Sneak skill you can do it anyway (the check is harder at night whether Liz is actually in the room or not). To get into the basement with her permission, go to Phil's place, buy stuff and tip him for a total of $20 (because of a bug the tips aren't deducted from your money), whereupon he reveals the secret of the weapons cache. Return to Liz, ask about the weapons and tell her you heard about them from a reliable source. Then tell her you'll use the weapons on the mutants and she'll let you take them.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
If when you ask Liz about the stash you choose the "it's all over town" line, you'll get stuck in dialogue mode. This is a serious bug that happens because the script tries to start a fight when you're still in dialogue. You can press 1 and Esc to exit, but you'll have to shut down the game entirely before you can play normally again. This also happens if you tell her "You" when she asks what you had in mind to kill, or if you fail a Speech check after giving her the "reliable source" line (save often!).</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
Liz restocks every 2-4 days, while Bill, Jacob and Holliday all restock every 3 days. For the latter three, prices will be significantly lower (50% in the case of Bill and the doctor) if you ask them to barter in dialogue instead of hitting the barter button. John L. Hunter points out that Liz's table restocks even after she is killed, though you still need Steal 25-30% to access it.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
IN&lt;4: Every time you trade with Liz, she takes a tenth of your money afterwards and calls it a "service charge". How's that for charity? Jacob only takes a small "tip". You need IN 2 to ask them to trade, but even if you have IN 1 you can get around this simply by pressing the barter button, which also circumvents the service charge. This means you have to pay their expensive rate, of course, but a stupid character wouldn't get Jacob's cheap rate anyway.</blockquote>

Marcus the mutant sheriff will join your party after you complete quests 1 and 2. You get 1000 xp for this, plus you can always grab his Minigun and stuff if you're not bringing him.<br><br>

Talk to Bill if you want to work as a caravan guard on routes to Vault City (on the 21st each month), NCR (on the 11th) and Gecko (on the 1st). These caravan jobs suck compared to the ones in Redding, since you get only $200 per job, plus there are no return caravans, effectively leaving you stranded. For general behaviour of caravans, see Redding. Should Chad get killed or if you abandon a caravan, you don't get paid and there will be no more caravans. If you choose to shovel brahmin crap, you get $100 each time, and after you've done it five times you get the Expert Excrement Expeditor special perk which gives you +5% to Speech and 500 xp. Bill will also sell stuff.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
IN&lt;4: You only get to shovel crap once (need IN 2 for this), so you don't get the perk.</blockquote>

Talk to Doc Holliday and listen to the story of his life. You'll get free healing from him (HP and damaged limbs except for eyes, same NPCs as Dr Troy in Vault City except he'll heal Laddie instead of Dogmeat and K-9), and also learn that he knows a certain Dr Fung in San Francisco, which is useful info. You can also get free healing if you ask what he does and banter a little, but you can only do that once, whereas you can get him to talk about his life over and over again. If for some reason you pay for healing he'll charge between $50 and $300 for each person. He'll sell you Stimpaks and stuff, and takes only half the price if you ask him to trade instead of hitting the barter button.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
If you have the car you won't be able to ask for party healing if you only have one NPC, but if you get the free healing he'll heal everyone anyway.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
IN&lt;4: Each time you pay for healing it costs $100 but you don't get healed, which is probably a bug (or is this old man really... evil?).</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
Only two containers on the western map have anything in them (except for the hidden footlockers, see below): one bookcase in Marcus' house which holds a Rubber Doll, and the small pot outside the house on the top right which holds a Cat's Paw. (Obviously these are for Typhon, along with the Rotgut from the bar.) The containers on the eastern Broken Hills map are <i>all</i> empty - the only item lying around is the Fuzzy Painting in Eric's house. Lazy, lazy level designers!</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
On the subject of "cheating within the workings of the game"... By the exit grid where you arrive in town, position your character between the exit and the the fence to the north, on the hex which is half offscreen. Then click on the other side of the fence and you'll end up there. Now, in the upper left corner of the map you'll find a few footlockers whose contents you can grab if you want to. They contain, from left to right: nothing, Jacob's stock, Holliday's stock and Bill's stock. All of them reset to full every three days, too, even Jacob's after you put him in jail. If the exit grid causes you trouble, instead go directly south, then work your way past the brahmin pen and the houses by clicking on the ground further away on the map. This way you can skirt around the map on the "outside" to reach the footlockers, even bypassing the exit grid on the right. The empty box is actually used for temporarily storing a shopkeeper's usual inventory while you're trading with them. As pointed out by John L. Hunter, you can stuff armed explosives into this box, then run quickly back and talk to a shopkeeper; after you leave dialogue they'll carry the explosives. Could be of interest if you want to try a really crazy assassination technique.</blockquote>

Talk to Typhon in the eastern part of town. Give him a Cat's Paw and wait one hour. Give him a Rubber Doll and wait for three hours. Give him a bottle of Rot Gut and he'll give you a clue as to where his hidden treasure might be. You also gain 2000 xp. The next part is purely optional. Go to the town well and manipulate it. You find the treasure, but it falls down the well, and you're too big to go down there. How appropriate that a small treasure hunter is just nearby! Talk to Micky and he goes down to retrieve... 10,000 Bottle Caps. Useless. And no, you can't get Micky back up again.<br><br>

Dan, the worried spouse, is in the house northeast of the Old Ghouls' Home. Agree to look for his wife (charging him if you want to), then after you've found the dead bodies in quest 2, return to Dan and break the news to him in whichever way you choose for 500 xp. If you're evil, you can take his $500 and then tell him you're not going to look for her after all. This will not make you popular.<br><br>

If you talk to the mad Professor in the lab coat, you can take Agility, Perception or Intelligence tests against his artificially smartened radscorpion. Take the AG and PE tests first for 500 xp each. You can match the scorpion with very low stats although you may have to try several times (it's impossible to actually outperform it). It turns out you can't win the IN test because the scorpion "cheats" at chess (or maybe it really is smarter). Time to look elsewhere for guidance. If you go to the field to the north you may notice a talking spore plant trying to draw your attention. Rrright. If you bring a Shovel you can help the plant by moving it to the Old Ghouls' Home for 1000 xp, and the plant will tell you how to beat the scorpion at chess. Return to the doctor and defeat the scorpion for 500 more xp. The scorpion will attack you, but just run away once and end combat and you won't have to kill it. Your party members will, though, if you don't park them somewhere else.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
IN&lt;4: The first time you pass the Agility test the Professor will give you a packet of Mentats. Actually he carries a ton.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
If you don't kill the scorpion you might want to steal the Spectacles off it. You can even steal its tail! If you want to hear it talk, get caught stealing from it.</blockquote>

You can enter the mine to the north, where several super mutants are standing about. To the right inside the entrance there's a heap of rocks. Place the movement cursor just inside the wall and you'll notice you can go there. You get 1000 xp for discovering this secret area. On the floor is a guy who will get up automatically when you move next to him. Ask him who he is for another 500 xp; if you choose the other line, or if you're stupid, he runs away instead. Get the Uranium Ore from the footlocker. There's another hidden cave near the top right of the map, but it's empty.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
There's an infinite experience bug here... if Stodgers is prevented from leaving the map, you can save and reload, and you'll be able to talk to him again with the same outcome. Saving will make him stop if he's running, as will entering combat mode. Placing an NPC in the narrow passage will ensure that Stodgers can't get anywhere at all, so that you can repeat this as many times as you like. Telling NPCs to wait means they won't take damage from the gas, but also that they won't level up with you if you take advantage of the bug.</blockquote>

Next bring the ore to the white ghoul in the refinery south of the caravan office. You'll have to fork out $1000 but you earn 500 xp. After the ghoul's done (takes a day) he'll offer to buy the ore back for $1500. You can either keep the ore (no use, Harold and Festus in Gecko won't even look at it), let him have it for $1500 and 300 xp, or let him have it for $1000, 1250 xp and some karma. I'd choose the latter.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
There's an infinite money bug here... if you take the extra $500, you can talk to the ghoul over and over again, choosing the same line and gaining $1500 each time. Once you're satisfied, either keep the ore or give it to him (though you can't get any more xp). Real <i>Fallout 2</i> players don't take advantage of poor stupid ghouls in this way.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
Some random encounter merchants in the Broken Hills area carry Uranium Ore, so it's possible to do the refining bit without finding Chuck Stodgers in the mine.</blockquote>

<ol>
<b></b><li><b>Fix the mine's air purifier.</b><br><br>

Go to Zaius in the building next to the mine entrance, agree to go get the spare parts and fix the purifier. If you ask for money you can get anything from $500 to $1000 depending on your bartering skills (you need to leave and re-enter dialogue at least once to get the last increment, which requires well over Barter 100%); you get half of it right away. Next you'll have to go to New Reno (which appears on your map) and get the Mine Parts from Renesco, which is very straightforward (except that you may have to deal with car thieves, see the New Reno section, quest 2). Note that if you ask Zaius for money he won't tell you the password to get the parts for free!<br><br>

Once you have the parts, return to the mine and head into it - leaving behind any party members who can't soak up about 30-50 damage without croaking. You need to use the Mine Parts on the purifier at the top of the map, so as the tunnels branch, go right, left, then left again, and you should be on the right track. As you run, you and all organic, non-canine party members plus the Robodog will occasionally take 10-15 damage, but unless you're all wimps it shouldn't be a problem, and it stops once you use the parts on the purifier (1500 xp). You can now kill off the vermin and even a deathclaw if you want to. Return outside for a reward from Zaius; if you asked for money you get the remaining half, if not you get a Combat Shotgun which is worth more.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
There is one way to avoid damage from the radon gas in the mine - wearing any kind of Power Armor, although you probably won't have it at this point. Several other kinds of protection have been said to do the trick, including having the Dermal Impact Armor, carrying or using the Oxygen Tank, running through the mine in combat mode, and having the Toughness perk. These do not work; staying in combat mode in fact means you'll take more damage. After you read a number of <i>Fallout 2</i> walkthroughs you get used to the idea that sometimes you'll be fed information which simply isn't true, speculation that at one point or another got written down as fact.</blockquote>

<b></b></li><li><b>Find the missing people for Marcus.</b><br><br>

Talk to Marcus and ask him what's new. Better tell him you'll do this for free. Over in the east part of town, you may notice there are three entrances to the underground (outhouse behind Eric's, carpet two houses east of Eric's, and manhole in field). Go down, beat up the ants (or pick them off from a distance, because your NPCs will happily fire bursts of valuable ammo at the ants if they get the chance), and walk into the room with the mutilated bodies. You get 500 xp for this. (The bodies won't show up until you've actually got the quest.) If you examine the bodies you notice they've been shot, but it makes no difference if you do or not. Take the note from the severed female body and read it. Your character will say you'd better not tell Marcus about the note... and in fact, you can't. If you talk to Zaius he only sends you to Francis. Turns out Francis killed those people... in self-defence, he says. You'll have to let him go, for 1000 xp, because if you attack him the whole town comes to his aid. The next step is to tell Marcus about the bodies. You should put this off until you've done quests 4 and 5 though, because Marcus will put Jacob away if he hasn't already done so. If you asked for money before you get $500, else he hands you a Scoped Hunting Rifle which is worth more.<br><br>

<b></b></li><li><b>Beat Francis at arm wrestling.</b><br><br>

Francis is the super mutant in the bar. For you to have any realistic chance of beating him, your ST and EN should correspond to 9/9 or better (8/10 will work, though you may have to reload a lot). Taking two Buffout should do the trick. You need ST 8 just to take him on, and must be level 6 or higher. There's a random element, so save before trying. If you lose, you'll find yourself the not-so-proud owner of a Ball Gag. If you win, Francis gives you a Power Fist and you gain 350 xp. Make sure you do this before you confront him with the note in quest 2.

IN&lt;4: You need IN 2 to challenge Francis; the other requirements are the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
You can use 2 Buffout on Francis and wait 6 hours for his stats to drop, allowing you to beat him a little more easily (8/5 should be enough). The effect is smaller than if you use them on yourself, though, so this is for when you just can't get your own stats into range, or you live in fear of chem addiction. There's no point in saving after using the chems on him, since the game doesn't save such changes to critters and he'll be back to normal once you reload.</blockquote>

<b></b></li><li><b>Break Manson and Franc out of prison.</b><br><br>

Talk to Jacob and don't tell him you like mutants (if you do you can't get this quest any more). You can go to Marcus right away and turn Jacob and Aileen in for 2500 xp... but that's unnecessary. Instead go to the jail, and make sure it's daytime and that you don't have a weapon ready, or the guards may shoot you on sight. There are basically three ways to solve the quest:<br><br>

<ul type="disc">
<li>With IN 7 and CH 7 you can talk the guard into giving you the key.
</li><li>You can kill the guards (beware that Minigun) without anyone else in town noticing and take the key.
</li><li>Unlock the door using Lockpick, or obtain the key through stealing (quite difficult even with good Steal) or barter (it's worth $0) and use that. You have to wait until the guard walks to the far end of the room, since he will stop you if he sees you tampering with the door (Sneak helps), and attack if this happens two times separated by more than a few seconds. A trick once you've unlocked the door is to walk into one of the adjacent rooms and one of your party members will probably walk through the jail door for you, assuming you have any.
</li></ul><br>

Once the door is open you're teleported back to Jacob for 1500 xp. If you fought the guards or if you were given the key you don't have to free the prisoners to return to Jacob for the next quest, though you get no xp for this one until you return and open the door (but you can do this even after you turn Jacob in, in which case Franc and Manson end up in Jacob's house while Jacob remains in prison).

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
Talk to Manson through the bars <i>before</i> talking to Jacob, ask him about Broken Hills and choose the long answer. You'll get 300 xp for "preaching open-mindedness to Manson". If you talk to Franc before getting this quest and tell him you hate mutants, he sends you to Jacob with a recommendation.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
Beware that if you choose the "Err... no, not really" line, the guard will turn hostile in about a minute, which could catch you a bit off guard.</blockquote>

<b></b></li><li><b>Blow up the mine's air purifier.</b><br><br>

Jacob will give you this task after you complete quest 4. The objective is to bring the Explosive Switch to the mine purifier. Now's a good time to turn him in! Go to Marcus and tell him all about the evil plans and you gain 2500 xp. Jacob and his band will end up in the jail. The same thing happens if you tell Marcus where he can find the escaped convicts.<br><br>

If you want to go through with the plan, run into the mine (see quest 1 for details) and use the switch on the purifier. (Using the switch after you expose the conspiracy will just make it disappear.) You'll gain 1500 xp and be teleported outside the mine. Return to Jacob and he'll say you can go loot Liz' basement for a reward (works the same as if you hear about it from Phil). You'll notice there are no mutants left in town except for Elmo the drunk, and Bill closes down his store and offers no more jobs.<br><br>

<b></b></li><li><b>Divert more electrical power to Eric's home.</b><br><br>

Eric's in the east part of town. Agree to get him more power for his air conditioning. Go to the power station at the entrance to town, and either talk Brian into giving Eric additional power using Speech (you only get one shot at this dialogue path), or use Science on the computer to the left, and you get 1000 xp. If you manage a critical success on the computer you get 1500 xp instead for optimizing the power grid. If you fail critically you'll get shocked for 10-15 points of damage. Return to Eric for a reward of either $150, one dose of Buffout (you won't be offered this if you already beat Francis), or extra karma and the location of NCR. I'd take the Buffout.

<blockquote><img height="12" src="./Fallout 2 Walkthrough_files/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align="left">
Need more Buffout to beat Francis at armwrestling? You can steal a lot more of it and some Mentats from Eric. <i>And</i> the $150. So maybe you should choose the karma reward instead. :)</blockquote>
